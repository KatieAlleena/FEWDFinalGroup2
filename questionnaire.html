  Night Shift
  <br>
Flash Fiction by Katie Alleena
<br>
Prompt: Overnight.
<br>
<br>
Humans have to sleep, and we don’t – that’s just the way of things. So in the name of progress, Elves run their forges at night. We keep their inn kitchens going. Humans lead such busy lives these days, treating rest like a chore. Money can’t be made while businesses stay closed, and so on. This is the modern age, I suppose.
<br>
<br> 
I look up at the stars who are my ancestors and wonder if we are judged for our complacency in all of this. I’m sure I could have been much more than a cook in another life, when the world seemed wider and much more mysterious. Now, they have filled in the edges of the map and tamed the wilderness. My people are relics of that bygone time. 
<br>
<br>
An era ago, I could have been king. Now there’s so few of us left, it isn’t worth the wars it would take to rule. I can’t remember the last time anyone even called on their magic, now that gold means power. Humans spend all their limited time rushing to acquire wealth; such wonder no longer matters to them. If we did change our world again, I could not imagine they would notice.
<br>
<br>
I crush the butt of my cigarette under the heel of my boot. My break is over. The sun is a few moments from rising, and the concrete stairs out back are no longer comfortable. The boss will be arriving, and by then breakfast should be frying. These humans… their lives are but a summer storm to us. Loud, obnoxious and over as fast as they begin. And what have I got but time? I return to the dimness of my kitchen, waiting as I always do for the bell on the front door to ring.
